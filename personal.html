                                 <p>My background was straight IT since middle school's computer science, until I discover the amazement of combining an old time hobby of mine, art, into the digital world. Since then, I had been constantly trying to improve my Digital Designing skills. IT and Design are my passion, and thus I had reeled myself into the path of being a media designer when moving to Singapore.</p>

                                       Designing is my passion and IT is my muse, I strived to be an <b>information designer</b> that can put the aesthetics in data. I'm aspired to create visually compeling designs that is pleasing to look at, and at the same time conveying the information fully, even with the most complicated and tedious concepts. To me the power of graphic communication is limitless!

                                        Professional competence is often the area in which INTJs shine most brilliantly. Their capacity for digesting difficult and complex theories and principles and converting them into clear and actionable ideas and strategies is unmatched by any other type. INTJs are able to filter out the noise of a situation, identifying the core thread that needs to be pulled in order to unravel others' messes so that they can be rewoven into something at once beautifully intricate and stunningly simple in its function.
